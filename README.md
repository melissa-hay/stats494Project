St 494 Project details
==============================

This repo contains the details for a project that applies machine learning 


Data source
------------
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle where it was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not previously combined. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used are:
- Cleveland: 303 observations
- Hungarian: 294 observations
- Switzerland: 123 observations
- Long Beach VA: 200 observations
- Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations

Total: 1190 observations

Duplicated: 272 observations

Final dataset: 918 observations

Every dataset used can be found under the Index of heart disease datasets from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/).
